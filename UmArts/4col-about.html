              <p>Um… Arts is the Research Centre for Architecture, Design and the Arts at Umeå University in Northern Sweden. The centre aims to create an exciting interdisciplinary arts research environment in the visual arts, architecture, design, curatorial and creative studies in partnership with Bildmuseet and within the regional context of Northern Sweden as well as nationally and internationally.</p>
              <p>Um… Arts aims to develop critical knowledge in artistic research by supporting interdisciplinary research between artistic and other fields, with high quality public dissemination and engagement. Um… Arts works across five departments Umeå Academy of Fine Arts, the Umeå School of Architecture (UMA), the Umeå Institute of Design (UID), the Department of Creative Studies and Bildmuseet. </p>

            <h2>Um… Arts Themes</h2>
            <p>The following interdisciplinary themes are proposed as starting points for reading groups, workshops, symposia, and joint research projects:</p>
            <h3 class="highlight tag-head">The Commons</h3>
            <p>The Commons is an old idea of collective use, access and ownership, which is revisited by every generation to create new frameworks for rethinking how we can work together. The practices of commoning have evolved from resisting enclosures and colonisation to practices of biodiversity and sustainability and further to the digital commons and open access publishing. The ideas of the commons reflect the values of UmArts as an undisciplined network for rethinking how we work together and helping to understand that democratic freedoms come with social responsibilities. Focusing on the practices of commoning and care (The Care Collective, 2020) creates a political space for thinking about the world otherwise (Dardot and Laval, 2019).</p
            <h3 class="highlight tag-head">Planetary Care</h3>
            <p>The concept of planetarity is introduced by Spivak (2003) who proposes planetary thinking to ‘overwrite’ the language and values of globalization. Here, the Planetary is a way of thinking about otherness, creating a space for imagining Earth from a perspective of another world – beyond the colonial and capitalist processes of globalisation, and the well-intentioned language of internationalism. To think on a planetary scale opens up possibilities of thinking about the future from a different perspective, valuing pre-capitalist culture, or culture outside of capital, towards new/old forms of collective responsibility. Responding to the climate crisis, and the breakdown into fragile and undervalued care systems, the idea of Planetary Care works towards new forms of collective care organisation, practice and analysis. Care is considered from a planetary perspective and scale, drawing on Donna Haraway’s notion of kinship (2016), and Anna Tsing’s analysis of survival in the ruins of capitalism (2015). Planetary Care invites us to take a holistic multispecies ecological perspective, joining all organisms, including humans, together (Tsing, Swanson, 2017). For this purpose, material analysis, speculative thought, intersectional feminist and decolonial perspectives, are essential for reimagining the ethical and the aesthetic world.</p>
            <h3 class="highlight tag-head">Nuclear Anthropocene</h3>
            <p>The Anthropocene is proposed as a new geologic era: where human activity has transformed the environment and climate, and is evidenced in the geologic strata. The Anthropocene was established as a key area of cultural discourse by the Anthropocene Project, HKW, Berlin (2013–2014), and has opened up diverse forms of geopolitical critique (Scheiderman, 2017), around indigeneity, geology and race (Yusoff, 2018). The Nuclear Anthropocene refers to the way in which nuclear fission has released man-made radionuclides into the environment through fallout from weapons testing and accidents. Naturally occurring radioactive elements are un-earthed by mining, which reorganises the surface of the planet, displacing indigenous people and creating newly contaminated landscapes. Hecht’s concept of nuclearity describes the uneven designation of nuclear sites and materials through nuclear coloniality (2012). The half-life of Uranium dates the origin of the planet earth at 4.5 billion years. In the 21st century, the underground storage of radioactive waste will create a new geologic layer 500 meters below ground for millions of years. This deep time future thinking highlights the importance of intergenerational contemporary responsibility in the present. The Nuclear Anthropocene invites us to consider the legacies of cold war infrastructures, deep time knowledge, geologic formations, nuclear decolonisation, and the many forms of anthropogenic toxic legacies from concrete to mercury, to be investigated through an analysis of materials, use and waste.</p>
            <h3 class="highlight tag-head">Decolonisation</h3>
            <p>Whilst it is impossible to undo the history of colonisation, we can enter into a practice of decoloniality to include new methodologies and forms of knowledge, and explore how this knowledge is produced, made visible and validated. In this way, decolonisation is an ongoing process of understanding and transforming colonial conditioning. We need to acknowledge that Umeå university is built on traditional Sámi land in the Arctic. It is important that we work towards decolonising the curriculum to expand the range of participants, languages, references (visual and textual), invitations and collaborations to be more inclusive. Creating spaces for allyship on a local and planetary level by holding spaces for indigenous and migrant voices, is central to understanding the role of art, culture and sustainability in society. It is essential to create platforms for decolonial discourse and representation through forming alliances, especially around issues of indigenous rights, refugees, migrant workers, and Sami Art Activism (Sandström, 2020). Decolonisation involves addressing pandemic racism and minority myths by specifically recognising the cultural, artistic and intellectual traditions of indigenous Sámi people in northern Sweden. </p>
